# Example of a dev branch pipeline to build and deploy the dev branch to a QA environment.
# The project name is set to 'Audacia.Template' throughout, so use find-and-replace to set a new name.
# Both deploy-staging.job and deploy.job refer to various variables groups therefore you must
# ensure they (or equivalent) are present.
# The pipeline can be modified to suit your purposes by adding/removing steps as appropriate.
#
# Build:
# The build stage runs three .NET builds (for an API, an Identity app and a seeding console app) and one npm build.
#
# Deploy:
# The deploy stage consists of two jobs: a deployment to a staging environment, and a deployment to a non-staging environment.
# The deploy-staging.job contains the following steps:
#  1. Config transformation
#  2. EF Core migrations to staging database
#  3. Deployments to web app staging slots
#  4. Calling healthcheck endpoints on API and Identity apps
#  5. Running the seeding app to seed a staging database
# The deploy.job contains the following steps:
#  1. Config transformation
#  2. FTP deployment of transformed config files to staging slots
#  3. EF Core migrations to non-staging database
#  4. Restart web apps
#  5. Deployment slot swaps
#  6. Calling healthcheck endpoints on API and Identity apps
#  7. Running the seeding app to seed a staging database
